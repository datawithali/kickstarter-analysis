# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project - The projects shows the correlation between the success rate vd Launch date and the targeted budget of the plays. 

### Purpose - The purpose of this analysis is to identify the relationships between the success rate vs Launch date and the targeted goals

## Analysis and Challenges
The The main part of the analysis was appyling the "COUNTIFS" formula for each requirment, and the rest was easy to calculate the success rate. 
Therefore, the biggest challenge was to imply the COUNTIFS formula for each requirement one by one, but after applying the countifs, 
the results showed that the challenge was worth of try. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date: Analysis shows that the projects started during May, shoed higher rate of success. 
May and June are the best time to launch the projects. The potential reason could be becuase of the summer vacation at schools. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals: 

Projects between 45000-49999 have 80% probabilty to fail. It could be becuase of approppriete budgeting knowledge. 
Projects between 35000-39999 shows 67% success rate, projects between that area has more potential to succeed than other budgeted projects. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The projectd launched during May shows higher success rate than other months. It could be becuase of summer vacation that kids or parents prefer to enjoy from the plays.
2. Projects started during the November and December have more potential to fail. It could be becuase of the holidays in several countries during those months. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. Projects that aimed to make around 45000-49999 showed the highest failure rate. It could be becuase of the ticket prices are not affordable or
 the opportinity cost of tickets are higher. 
2. Projects that aimed to make between 35000-39999 showed the highes success rate. 
It could be becuase of the ticket price seemed affordable for the consumers. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
Demographic info:
We need: Income information of the people around the play locations, 
we need: Family information, how many of people have kids who lives close to play locations
We need: Age group of the people who lives close to play locations
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Relationship between countries vs success rate
Relationship between blurbs vs success rate. Maybe some words can encourage or discourage people to donate.
